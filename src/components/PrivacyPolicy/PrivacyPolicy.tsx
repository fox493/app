            These employees have duties that reasonably require access to your Personal Information. We take the

            measures include internal reviews, storage and processing practices and security measures as well as
            physical measures to prevent unauthorised access to systems where we store Personal Information.
          </p>

            countries may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through foreign laws. You need to be
            aware that the privacy standards of those countries may be lower than those of the jurisdiction in which you
            reside. You should note that you are not obliged to give your Personal Information to Raft, but if you
            choose not to do so, we may not be able to provide our services, or your access to our services may be

            protection laws.
          </p>
